# MettHub

This is a simple demonstration of building and running ASP.NET applications in a Docker container and part of this [blog post](https://www.lise.de/blog/permalink/63/). 

## Usage

Start Docker for Windows and switch to Windows containers.

Run `docker-compose up` in the repository folder and wait for the build process to complete.

Access the running app at `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
